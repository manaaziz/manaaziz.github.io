My name is Mana Azizsoltani and I am currently attending North Carolina State University for my master's degree in statistics. I have always considered myself an *undercover nerd*, but in the recent years I have really embraced my nerdiness.  

Here are two truths and a lie about me. Can you guess which is the lie?:  
* I have a 3 year old daughter  
* I am 20 years old  
* I have been to 25 states    

### More Information

Some of my hobbies include travel, soccer, and listening to music.
