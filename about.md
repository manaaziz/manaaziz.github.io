My name is Mana Azizsoltani and I am a 20-year-old from Las Vegas, Nevada. I am currently attending North Carolina State University for my master's degree in statistics. I have always considered myself an "undercover nerd", but in the recent years I have really embraced my nerdiness.

### More Information

Some of my hobbies include travel, soccer, and music (listening, not production).
