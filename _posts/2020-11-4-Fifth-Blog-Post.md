Here I am, watching the embers burn out on another semester. Looking back on my words from my very first post about data science, I can now see how far I have come. Nothing has really changed about what I think a data scientist does, but I have gained a greater appreciating for what they do. In general, I would say that I really don't like coding that much, but I didn't hate doing the assignments for this class (except for the API part of the first project). To be a great data scientist I think one needs many different tools, since the job is really broad in scope. Anything that requires data, you need to know.

I think R is a FANTASTIC tool for data science. I love how open it is, how helpful the community is, how simple it seems to learn, and more than anything else, how much less frustrating it is than SAS. I have been using R in all of my courses this semester, even when it seemed easier to just use the professor's SAS code. That being said I will definitely keep using R for all of my statistical computing needs. Plus, R Markdown is the perfect tool for homework, since you can easily have all you R code and output embedded in one place, not to mention the great functionality with LaTeX for formulas and other math-y things.

In practice, I am going to use R for all of my calculator and model-fitting needs. The `caret` package is pretty much the greatest thing ever for modeling. Like I mentioned previously, I will definitely use R Markdown for all of my homework assignments and reports. Also, I will use github much more frequently to be able to collaborate with others. Github for me is like a google doc but for code, which makes it really efficient for group work. Lastly, if one of my buddies learning stats gets stuck with a garbage professor, I can make a shiny app to help explain some concepts like the central limit theorem and sample variances.
