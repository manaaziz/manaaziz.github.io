Data science is a relatively new and revolutionary field. I think that although many of us come from a traditional "stats" background, we think of data science as just another branch of statistics. It is my understanding that although they are complimentary in many ways, the starting point and scope of data science is quite different. Data science is as it implies: the science of data. The scope of data science is anything that has to do with the data itself. This includes data collection, cleaning, exploration, analysis, and presentation/visualization. To me, being a data scientist is being able to do everything in relation to data, whether it is for statistics or not.

As I mentioned previously, I believe that the major duties of the data scientist are: collection, cleaning, exploration, analysis, and presentation/visualization of the data. The data scientist must have a wide variety of knowledge in different areas to be able to excel at these roles. They must be proficient in programming, applied statistics, a variety of softwares, and mathematics. The data scientist must be able to bring together all of these different disciplines to find data-driven solutions to problems.

Data scientists and statisticians share a wide variety of qualities.
