As a Las Vegas native, I really wanted to do something with Vegas Golden Knights (VGK). I chose to work with roster data from the 2017/2018 season because that was their first season as a franchise. They took the whole NHL by storm and became conference champions. I donâ€™t really know that much about hockey, but VGK brought the Las Vegas community together after the tragic October 1st shooting. One of my favorite hobbies *was* to go to public ice skating at the Golden Knights practice facility.  

What I did in this particular project was pull data from the championship VGK roster and analyzed various aspects of the team and its **field** players (I omitted the goalie stats because their stats are measured differently). I was able to look at the distributions of shots, goals, assists, etc. I also went through and sorted the players by nationality, dominant hand, and position and looked at the average goals scored in the season for each group. I found that there were actually a lot of Canadians on the team; there were actually more Canadians on the team than every other nationality combined. I also found that generally wingers are put on the side of their dominant hand. That means that a right winger would typically be right-handed.  

Although I am happy with the way that I approached and completed the project, I think it would have benefitted me if I would have planned out the project in a outline-type format on paper. That was one of the techniques that I learned in ST555 that really helped me, especially on larger, more complex assignments. The hardest part of this project for me was dealing with querying the data. I really hated that first querying-data part, so it made it hard for me to get going initially. Once I finished writing the functions for the data querying, I began to actually have fun with the project and everything else just kinda fell into place. 

Moving forward, I will definitely start out with a traditional, pencil-and-paper outline for the project. It would save me time in flipping back and forth between the instructions, the internet, and RStudio. In doing this project, I realized how useful and cool github is! I often work on my programming assignments between two computers, relying on Apple's iCloud Drive to keep my files safe and up-to-date between my devices. Github makes it really easy to save and upload files betweeen devices. And the fact that it is right there in RStudio makes it the perfect tool.
