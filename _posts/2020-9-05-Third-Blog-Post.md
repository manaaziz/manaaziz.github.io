As a Las Vegas native, I really wanted to do something with Vegas Golden Knights (VGK). I chose to work with roster data from the 2017/2018 season because that was their first season as a franchise. They took the whole NHL by storm and became conference champions. I donâ€™t really know that much about hockey, but VGK brought the Las Vegas community together after the tragic October 1st shooting.
